# The Babysitter

By Garry Francis

## Background

Mr and Mrs Graham have gone out to a movie and left you to babysit their young daughter, Anna. What could be easier? Anna is in bed, so you settle down on the living room couch and fall asleep.

In your sleep, you dream that Mr and Mrs Graham come home and find Anna missing. The police are called, a city-wide search is instigated and you are severely reprimanded...and rightly so. Amid the waves of embarrassment, shame and utter humiliation when everyone makes you look stupid, you suddenly wake up in a cold sweat.

You look around and see that you're still on the couch and everything seems fine. But is it? You had better check on Anna.

This is a traditional text adventure based on 'Midnight Emergency' by John H Doolittle. The game is hosted at [The Babysitter](https://drdooriddle.itch.io/babysitter).
